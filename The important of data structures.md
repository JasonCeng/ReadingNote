>Computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty. A programmer who subconsciously views himself as an artist will enjoy what he does and will do it better.——Donald Knuth

>I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he consider his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about structures and their relationships.——Linux Torvalds(creator of Linux)
